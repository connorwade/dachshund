2. `cd dachshund` enter the directory
3. `go build` to build the tool
4. `./dachshund config <yourdomain>` to create a config file
5. `./dachshund crawl` to start your site crawl
6. `./dachshund report` to create a csv report of broken links

## Current Features

Right now, Dachshund only supports broken link reporting. A rough roadmap of future development:
